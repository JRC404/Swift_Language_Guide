title: "What is Swift?"
---

**Swift** is a programming language created by Apple to use on all of its platforms (not just iPhones!) - **iOS**, **macOS**, **watchOS** & **tvOS**. So whether you want to make an awesome app for your Apple Watch, or a command line app for your Macbook - Swift is what you need. 

It's a modern, general-purpose programming language with a super clean syntax. It's incredibly fun to write and can be used to make some amazing things for the Apple ecosystem.

It's important to recognise Swift is a compiled programming language, which basically means your source code is translated into machine code *before* it runs. So there's a build stage and a run stage - Xcode will do this for you ðŸ˜† If you're coming from a JavaScript background, you'll be used to using an Interpreted language, where no pre-runtime translation takes place.

The compilation step can be extremely useful for checking your code is all good before attempting to run it. So useful infact that Typescript was invented to add a compiler to JavaScript (among other things!)

##A little bit of history

Swift 1.0 was released in 2014 as an alternative to a language called Objective-C, which up until then was the main language Apple used for app development. Today we are working with Swift 5.2 (as of March 24th 2020) although developers can still use Objective-C if they choose to.

As both languages use the same runtime-environment, Objective-C code and Swift code can run in the same program. However, Swift is seen as a faster, safer language to use with a nicer, easier to read syntax.
